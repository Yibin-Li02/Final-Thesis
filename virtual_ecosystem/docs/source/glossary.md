# Glossary

```{glossary}

POM
  Particulate Organic Matter. A form of organic matter that derives from the
  decomposition and fragmentation of litter and other necromass. Generally, these
  particulates are still in a state where the tissue they originated from can be
  determined. This chemical complexity makes this a form of protected carbon, however this
  is generally only a significant store of protected carbon in heavily waterlogged soils.

MAOM
  Mineral Associated Organic Matter. This is organic matter which has formed a strong
  association with soil minerals. This association impedes breakdown, making this a form
  of protected carbon and typically accounts for for a large proportion of total carbon
  stock in the soil.

LMWC
  Low Molecular Weight Carbon. These are organic molecules that are simple and soluble,
  i.e. molecules that do not require further transformation to be transportable across
  cell membranes. Thus, the availability of this type of organic matter strongly
  determines microbial growth rates.

DON
  Dissolved Organic Nitrogen. Nitrogen associated with soil carbon that is in a form
  that can readily dissolve. The carbon in this form is considered to be low molecular
  weight carbon and so this is essentially the nitrogen content of the {term}`LMWC` pool.

DOP
  Dissolved Organic Phosphorus. Phosphorus associated with soil carbon that is in a form
  that can readily dissolve. The carbon in this form is considered to be low molecular
  weight carbon and so this is essentially the phosphorus content of the {term}`LMWC` pool.

soil moisture
  The amount of water held in the soil, typically expressed as volumetric water content
  (m3/m3 or %) or as depth of water per unit area (mm).

soil moisture capacity
  The maximum amount of water a soil can retain against gravity, often referring to
  water content at field capacity. Expressed in m3/m3, %, or mm.

soil moisture residual
  The water content remaining in the soil after it has drained beyond the point of plant
  availability. Expressed in m3/m3, %, or mm.

soil moisture at field capacity
  The amount of water the soil retains after excess water has drained and gravitational
  flow slows. This is the upper limit of plant-available water. Expressed in m3/m3, %,
  or mm.

effective soil moisture
  The portion of soil water available for plant uptake, typically the range between
  residual moisture and field capacity. Expressed in m3/m3, %, or mm.

effective saturation
  Rescaled soil water saturation so that it takes a value of zero at the physical
  minimum ({term}`soil moisture residual`) and a value of one at the physical maximum
  ({term}`soil moisture saturation`). This can also be referred to as the normalised
  water content.

relative soil moisture
  A ratio expressing the amount of water in soil, as a percentage, compared to the total
  water-holding capacity between the wilting point (very dry) and saturation (very wet)
  for a given soil type. Expressed as a unitless ratio (0–1) or %.

specific soil moisture
  Commonly refers to volumetric soil moisture content—the volume of water per volume of
  soil (%). In some contexts, it may also describe soil moisture at a specific location
  or layer, or (less commonly) the derivative of the water retention curve (specific
  moisture capacity). Alternative meaning (specific moisture capacity): 1/m or unitless
  per unit suction (if used in hydrological modeling).

permanent wilting point
  The water content at which plants can no longer extract moisture, leading to wilting
  and potential plant death. Water is still present in the soil, but it is tightly bound
  and unavailable to plants. This is lower limit of plant-available water. Expressed in
  m3/m3, %, or mm.

available water capacity
  Amount of water that a soil can store and make available to plants, defined as the
  difference between field capacity and the permanent wilting point. Expressed in
  m3/m3, %, or mm.

soil moisture saturation
  Maximum amount of water a soil can hold when all its pores are completely filled with
  water — that is, the soil is fully saturated and contains no air in the pore spaces.
  Expressed in m3/m3, %, or mm.

soil matric potential
  The potential energy of water in soil due to the adhesive forces between water
  molecules and soil particles, affecting how water is retained and moves through the
  soil. It is typically negative and measured in units of pressure, such as kilopascals
  (kPa), or as an equivalent water column height (cm or m).

gravitational head
  The potential energy of water in soil or an aquifer due to its elevation relative to a
  reference level, influencing the direction and rate of water movement. It is typically
  measured in units of length, such as meters (m), representing the height of a water
  column.
