# Soil and litter

The storage and cycling of carbon and nutrients within the soil are key processes we aim
to capture in the Virtual Ecosystem. This requires modelling soil specific processes, as
well as litter decay processes that occur both within the topsoil (e.g. for dead roots)
and within the above ground litter layer.

The soil theme is split into two separate models. On one hand, the [litter
model](./litter_theory.md) handles the breakdown of biomass that's still in an
identifiable form, both in the above-ground litter layer as well as below ground.
On the other hand, the soil model handles the processes that are specific to the soil,
i.e. the [soil carbon](./soil_carbon.md) and [macronutrient](./macronutrients.md) cycles.

The litter model is significantly simpler than the soil model. The biggest uncertainty
in this model are the rates at which different types of litter decay, and this can be
parameterised relatively well from common empirical data. The model
provides reasonably good estimates of the standing stocks of litter and the rates at
which carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus enter the soil.

In contrast, the soil model is more detailed in order to address deeper uncertainties
about nutrient transformations within the soil. The two biggest uncertainties in the
soil model are the long-term fate of soil carbon and the impact of plant--microbe
interactions on uptake rates of nutrients by plants. We believe that the soil-related
uncertainties are of greater consequence, so we have made the conscious choice to focus more
detailed modelling of soil processes than the litter processes. Therefore, the soil
model explicitly represents the soil [microbial
community](./microbial_representation.md), which is the main driver of decomposition in soils.
Explicitly represented microbes presents major data challenges, as soils are
generally poorly characterised compared to the other constituent parts of terrestrial
ecosystems.

Most processes in the soil are effected by both the environmental temperature and the
soil moisture. The specifics of how we have implemented these known effects are provided
[here](./environmental_links.md).

:::{admonition} Future directions ðŸ”­

There are ecologically explicit extensions to the litter model - such as
modelling of litter microbial communities - that could increase the realism of
litter model, but the current model is expected to be sufficient in the short term.
